# game-template
Simple game engine template

This is currently just some proof of concept material to test out different
approaches to managing game assets and handling the creation and movement
of graphical assets via OpenGL.

The goal of this project is a very simple 2D/3D video game engine with as
little external dependencies as possible for portability reasons.

This project will be maintained with both a Visual Studio project/solution
and the standard GNU build environment (autotools, make, gcc, binutils)
